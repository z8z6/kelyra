# Kelp

Kelp is the project manager for Kelyra.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure

./build/kelp new hello
cd hello
kelp build
kelp run
```

Projects are described by `kelp.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "hello"
version = "0.1.0"
entry = "src/main.kly"

[build]
compiler = "kelyra"
kind = "executable"
output = "hello"
optimization = 0
safe-level = 0
runtime = "host"
target = ""
c-sources = []
c-libraries = []
windows-import-libraries = []
c-args = []

[package]
output = "hello-0.1.0.tar.gz"

[test]
sources = []

[dependencies.kstd]
repository = "git@github.com:z8z6/kstd.git"
revision = "main"
```

Supported commands are `new`, `init`, `members`, `check`, `build`, `output`,
`run`, `test`, and `package`. `package` builds the project and creates the
configured `.tar.gz` source archive.

`build --debug` overrides optimization with `-O0` without changing `kelp.toml`.
`output` prints the absolute configured artifact path without building or
fetching dependencies; editor integrations use it to configure a debugger.
Builds report preparation, compilation, and completion on stderr, including the
entry/output paths. Kelyra's `--progress` lists every loaded `.kly` module, C header,
C source, and the code-generation/link stages. These are phase counters, not
time-based percentages; a failed build never reports successful completion.

Every command reports wall-clock durations on stderr: a per-project
`checked`/`built`/`tested`/`packaged` line, plus a workspace total when the
selection covers more than one project. Durations use `s`/`ms` units and cover
dependency resolution and compilation, so they are useful for spotting slow
members and for CI trend tracking.

## Subprojects

A `kelp.toml` may list subprojects under `[workspace] members`. Each member is a
directory with its own `kelp.toml`, and members may nest recursively:

```toml
[workspace]
members = ["libs/math", "apps/demo"]
```

A workspace root may also be a project itself. `kelp members` prints every
project in the tree as `<path> <name> <kind> <output>`; a workspace root without
its own `[project]` is listed with `-` for both name and output.

Commands accept an optional `<member>` selector, matched by project name or by
the member's path relative to the workspace root, and a `--workspace` flag:

```sh
kelp build                   # the current project, or every member of a pure workspace
kelp build --workspace       # the current project and every member
kelp build math              # only the member named math
kelp output apps/demo        # by relative path
kelp check --workspace
kelp test --workspace
kelp package --workspace
```

Members are visited before their parent so dependencies build first. `run`
always targets a single executable project, and `output` always prints a single
artifact path.

`build.kind` selects what `kelp build` produces:

- `executable` (default) links an executable at `build.output`;
- `library` compiles the project to an object file (default `<name>.o`) and
  rejects `kelp run`.

Every project builds into the workspace cache instead of a `build` directory of
its own. Artifacts live at `.kelp/build/<project path>`, so `libs/math` produces
`.kelp/build/libs/math/math.o` and the workspace root project produces
`.kelp/build/<name>`. `build.output` and `package.output` name the artifact
inside that directory; a leading `build/` written by older manifests still
means the directory itself. A single ignored `.kelp/` therefore covers every
project, and `kelp members` reports the path relative to the workspace root.

A library is compiled once and linked, not copied into every consumer. When a
project depends on a library, Kelp builds that library's object, passes its
source directory to Kelyra as an `--external-path` (so the consumer emits only
declarations for its modules) and passes the object as a `--link-input`. The
library's configured C sources are compiled into that object. That
is how subprojects reference each other: put the shared code in a `library`
project and depend on it; executable-kind dependencies stay source-level. A
library dependency builds with the consumer's compiler and shares its
dependency cache.

For an existing library, set `library` on the dependency. Kelp still uses its
source directory for module declarations, but skips its build and links the
supplied object or archive:

```toml
[dependencies.math]
path = "../libs/math"
library = "prebuilt/math.o" # relative to the dependency project
```

`build.c-sources` compiles C source files; `build.c-libraries` links existing
C objects or archives. List only the C sources that still need compilation.
`build.windows-import-libraries` lists bare Windows SDK `.lib` names, such as
`Synchronization.lib`. Kelp passes them only for Windows targets, including
when a library dependency declares them; non-Windows builds ignore them.

`build.runtime = "freestanding"` selects Kelyra's explicit startup and
`-nostdlib` executable link on supported targets (Linux x86-64 and Windows
x86-64). The default `"host"` keeps the platform C runtime startup. This
setting applies to executable projects; library projects inherit their
consumer's link mode.

`build.target` optionally selects an LLVM target triple for compilation;
empty means the native target. Cross-platform linking still requires a
matching linker and platform system libraries.

## Dependencies

Dependencies use Git repositories or local paths. Kelp clones Git dependencies
into `.kelp/dependencies`, checks out `revision` when provided, and passes each
dependency source directory to Kelyra as a `--module-path` search directory.
Executable dependencies' C sources are compiled into the final executable;
library dependencies include them in their own object. Sources are
compiled where they live: Kelp never copies them into a staging tree, so
diagnostics and debug information point at the real files. Modules in the
project's own source directory take priority, followed by dependency
directories in resolution order.

A path dependency is used in place and is never cloned, which keeps a sibling
checkout visible without a Git round trip:

```toml
[dependencies.math]
path = "../libs/math"
```

The path is resolved relative to the manifest (absolute paths are allowed) and
must contain a `kelp.toml`. Either `repository`/`revision` or `path` may be
given for one dependency, never both. Path and Git dependencies may mix in one
project, and both participate in cycle detection.

In a workspace, every member shares the workspace root's `.kelp/dependencies`
cache, even when a command runs from inside a member, so a Git dependency is
cloned and fetched once for the whole tree instead of once per member. If two
members request the same dependency name from different repositories or
revisions, Kelp reports a conflict rather than silently repointing the shared
cache.

Kelp searches parent directories for `kelp.toml`, so commands also work from a
project subdirectory. The parser intentionally supports the TOML values used
above: tables, quoted strings, non-negative integers, booleans, and string
arrays.
